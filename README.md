# Clustering-autism-phenotypes-by-automated-text-analysis

## Purpose
Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that patients can have a wide variety of symptoms and linked conditions. It is not currently known if there is a single cause of autism, or multiple different causes that all "look" like autism at diagnosis. One approach that has been used to try to address this issue has been to use cluster analysis on a variety of features.

We will create a pipeline to use the vocabulary that exists in published PubMed abstracts to cluster types of autism. Comparison of these clusters may be informative about the underlying etiology of autism.
